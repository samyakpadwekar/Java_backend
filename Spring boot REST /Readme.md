### 1.What is Spring Rest?
- "Spring REST" is a term that is often used to refer to the development of RESTful web services using the Spring Framework, particularly with Spring Web MVC.
- REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and it is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
- In the context of Spring, "Spring REST" typically involves using Spring's capabilities to build web services that follow REST principles

### 2.Explain Spring Rest features.
Spring provides the Spring Web MVC module, which is commonly used for building RESTful web services. It offers features such as: \
1. *Annotation-driven controllers*: Controllers can be annotated with @RestController to indicate that they handle RESTful requests. This annotation simplifies the process of building RESTful endpoints. 
2. *Request mapping*: URLs can be mapped to specific controller methods using annotations like @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc. 
3. *Content negotiation*: Spring supports content negotiation to produce and consume different representations (e.g., JSON or XML) based on client preferences. 
4. *Data binding*: Spring can automatically bind HTTP request parameters, form data, or JSON/XML payloads to Java objects, simplifying data handling. 
5. *Exception handling*: Spring provides mechanisms for handling exceptions gracefully and returning appropriate error responses to clients. 
6. *Security*: Spring Security can be integrated to secure RESTful APIs with authentication and authorization mechanisms.
7. *Testing*: Spring offers testing support for unit and integration testing of REST controllers and endpoints.
- In summary, "Spring REST" refers to the practice of using the Spring Framework, particularly Spring Web MVC, to design and implement RESTful web services that adhere to REST architectural principles.
- These services are typically used to expose data or functionality over HTTP for consumption by various clients, such as web applications, mobile apps, or other services.

### 3.How Spring REST is beneficial?
1. *Resource-Oriented*: Spring REST is designed specifically for building RESTful APIs. It uses the @RestController annotation, making it clear that this controller is focused on handling REST requests. 
2. *Simplified Responses*: Spring REST simplifies response handling. You return objects directly from controller methods, and Spring automatically serializes them to JSON or XML based on the request's Accept header. 
3. *Clear URL Structure*: RESTful URLs like /api/books and /api/books/{id} are straightforward and intuitive for clients to understand. 
4. *Statelessness*: REST follows the stateless architecture, which can lead to more scalable and cacheable APIs.
- By transitioning to Spring REST, you've created a cleaner, more focused API for managing books.
- Clients can interact with the API using HTTP methods, and the responses are in a format (typically JSON or XML) that's easier to consume programmatically.
- This approach simplifies the development and integration of client applications, making it well-suited for building web services and APIs.

Let's start by implementing a basic Spring MVC application and then enhance it to become a Spring REST application. We'll use a simple "Book" entity for illustration. \

*Step 1: Implement Spring MVC* 

*Book Entity*:
```
@Entity
public class Book {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String title;
    private String author;

    // Constructors, getters, setters, etc.
}
```

*Book Controller*: 
```
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/books")
public class BookController {
    @Autowired
    private BookService bookService;

    @GetMapping
    public String listBooks(Model model) {
        List<Book> books = bookService.getAllBooks();
        model.addAttribute("books", books);
        return "book/list";
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public String viewBook(@PathVariable Long id, Model model) {
        Book book = bookService.getBookById(id);
        model.addAttribute("book", book);
        return "book/view";
    }

    // Other controller methods for creating, updating, and deleting books
}
```

In this Spring MVC example, we have a BookController that handles HTTP requests for listing books and viewing book details. The views are typically implemented using JSP, Thymeleaf, or another template engine. \

*Step 2: Enhance with Spring REST*

Now, let's enhance this Spring MVC application to become a Spring REST application by adding Spring Web's REST capabilities.

*Book Controller for Spring REST*:
```
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/books")
public class BookRestController {
    @Autowired
    private BookService bookService;

    @GetMapping
    public List<Book> listBooks() {
        return bookService.getAllBooks();
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public Book viewBook(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return bookService.getBookById(id);
    }

    @PostMapping
    public Book createBook(@RequestBody Book book) {
        return bookService.createBook(book);
    }

    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public Book updateBook(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Book book) {
        return bookService.updateBook(id, book);
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public void deleteBook(@PathVariable Long id) {
        bookService.deleteBook(id);
    }
}
```
